CUSTOMER VIEW:-
1)This application will first display all of the items available for sale. That Includes the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.
2)The app should then prompt users with two messages.

   * The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
   
MANAGER VIEW:-

 Running this application will:
  * List a set of menu options:-
        * View Products for Sale
        * View Low Inventory
        * Add to Inventor
        * Add New Product

  1) If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app should list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

  2) If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it should list all items with an inventory count lower than five.

  3) If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently       in the store.

  4) If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
